# Exploring Supabase with Flutter 🚀

Welcome to my Supabase with Flutter project! In this project, I explored Supabase, an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS), and integrated it with Flutter to build a full-stack application. Supabase offers powerful backend services like a real-time PostgreSQL database, authentication, storage, and more, making it an excellent choice for modern app development.

🎨 Project Highlights

    Supabase Authentication: Implemented email/password authentication for user signup and signin functionality.
    CRUD Operations: Developed Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage and manipulate data.
    Image CRUD Operations: Utilized Supabase's storage buckets to manage media such as images, allowing easy upload, fetch, and delete operations.
    Real-Time Updates: Supabase’s real-time capabilities ensure seamless data synchronization between the frontend and backend.

🛠️ Technologies Used

    Flutter: A UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop.
    Dart: The programming language used to build Flutter apps.
    Supabase: A real-time database service that provides authentication, storage, and other backend services for apps.
    PostgreSQL: The real-time database engine that powers Supabase.
